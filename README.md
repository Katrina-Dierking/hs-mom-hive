## 🍎 ABOUT HOMESCHOOLING MOM HIVE: 
    
    💥 The problem it solves: 
        - Homeschooling Mom Hive gives homeschooling moms a place to interact strictly with other homeschooling moms in a safe place without the distractions and drama of a wide-range social media site. 

    The Homeschooling Mom Hive was born out of my own desire to meet with other homeschooling moms across the world without having to go through Facebook to do it. I wanted to avoid the distractions and negativity of social media but still needed to connect with other moms.
